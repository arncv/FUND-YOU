## Inspiration
 Being a creator is a very tedious & expensive job. Patreon helped them monetize their content and create a community but in return charged 2.5-5% of the creator's earnings. We wanted to create a platform that would help creators monetize their content without charging them any fees. We also wanted to create a platform that would help creators connect with their fans and create a community. 
 
 

## What it does
FUND YOU is a platform that allows creators to monetize their content and connect with their fans. Creators can create a profile and post content for their fans to see. Fans can subscribe to their favorite creators and support them. Creators can also create a community for their fans to interact with each other.

## How we built it
 The website was built with HTML5, CSS3 & SASS. Along with these, we used Coil Web Monetization kit to help creator ship out their exclusive content to subscribed users.

## Challenges we ran into
 The biggest challenge faced by us was the integration of coil & the time constraints associated with it.
 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
 The User-Interface of the website is really minimal and intuitive. 
 
 

## What we learned
 * Learned Coil , had a ton of fun using it !
 * DALL-E was fun, the logo was generated by an AI :) 



## What's next for FUND-YOU
 * We plan to add a feature that would allow creators to create a community for their fans to interact with each other.

 * More payment options for creators to withdraw their earnings.


See the [open issues](https://github.com/arncv/FUND-YOU/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
